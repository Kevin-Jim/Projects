Project 1, is a snake and ladder game, it is possible to play with many players but has been limited to two.
Highlights of P1: Implements recursive method in line 400 of LadderAndSnakes class that is able to order a large
amount of players in a random way, which was not asked in the task, but helped me to improve my recurssion Skills.

Project 2, is a library that is given a record of books with multiple errors and check for them, once checked it converts
them to Book objects. Then the user can see the corrected records.
